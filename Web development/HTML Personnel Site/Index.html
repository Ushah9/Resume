       <li> Of course, it’s unlikely that at the beginning, you'll be able 
        to code up Clash of Clans or League of Legends. But you’ll 
        be able to make something interesting. It could be a dice 
        game or a flash-card app. But as long at the end of the 
        tutorial, you’ll have made something you can use and play 
        with, then you’ll be far more motivated to code to the end.</li> 
        <p />
    <li> During all our courses, we always tell our students to think 
        up a simple app that they want to make. Something that 
        uses the skills that they’ve learned during the course but 
        will also stretch them a little because they have to find out 
        how to include some new functionality.</li>
